      <h2>Life of Wagener</h4>
      <p>Wagener studied Industrial Design at the University of Duisburg-Essen (1990â€“1993), after which he specialized his studies in Transportation Design at The Royal College of Art in London. After college, he worked as an exterior designer for Volkswagen, Mazda and General Motors. In 1997 he joined Mercedes-Benz as a transportation designer and became the manager for the exterior and interior styling of the R-,ML- and GL-Class models in 1999 and moving onto the A-, B-, C-, E-, CLK- and CLS-Class in 2002. He moved to the Advanced Design studio in the US in 2006 and became Director of Design Strategy and Global Advanced Design in 2007. The following year he was promoted to Vice President Design of Daimler AG where he developed the company style called "sensual purity" in 2009. Wagener was appointed Daimler's Chief Design Officer in 2016, becoming a board member of the company.</p>

      <h2>Wagener's Style</h4>
      <p>Important brands are characterised by their own special style - that's what makes the difference. The style of our house, which we have continued to refine over the past 15 years, is our design philosophy of Sensual Purity. It is our aesthetic soul and the core of our brand DNA. With it, we have created independent product personalities and given all Mercedes brands an unmistakable appearance. Our design language uniquely combines beauty with the extraordinary. To create tension, for example, we link opposites - this deliberate bipolarity of emotion and intelligence characterises our designs. Beauty forms the emotional core for us - it has its very own magic. Everything we do must be aesthetic. Beauty fascinates people and exerts a great attraction - all around us: in nature, in art, in fashion - and even in cars. But that alone is not enough for us: We strive to give beauty the additional glamour of the extraordinary. That is what we aim for as Mercedes designers: revolutionary products that touch people emotionally and that people absolutely want to have.</p>
