          <h2>Life of Wagener</h2>
          <div id="lifeContentOne">
            <p>
              In 1990–1993 at the University of Duisburg–Essen, Wagener majored in Industrial Design. During 1993–1995
              at the Royal College of Art in London, he focused on Transportation Design. He worked as an external
              designer for Volkswagen, Mazda, and General Motors after graduating from college. As a transportation
              designer, he joined Mercedes-Benz in 1997. In 1999, he was promoted to manager of
              exterior and interior styling for the R, ML, and GL-Class models. In 2002, he moved on to the A, B, C, E,
              CLK, and CLS-Class. In 2006, he relocated to the US Advanced Design office, and in 2007, he was appointed
              Director of Design Strategy and Global Advanced Design. He received a promotion the following year,
              becoming Daimler AG's Vice President of Design. The position of Chief Design Officer at Daimler was given
              to Wagener.

            <h2>Wagener's Style</h2>
          </div>
          <div id="designContentOne">
            <p>
              Wagener's designs start with a normal design and then get transformed with the use of new parameters of
              the electric and digital world. His focus is based on how can they design cars differently than cars have
              been done for the past 100 years. Taking electric vehicles to an advantage, Wagener designs cars to allow
              for a futuristic look while providing a glider feel. Personally, the Vision-Mercedes Maybach 6 looks the
              best since it looks futuristic, but is not too futuristic like the Mercedes-Benz F015 Concept. Wagener's
              designs prove that for something to be futuristic, not only it has to have a design change, but it needs
              to
              have futuristic quality.

              "Important brands are characterised by their own special style -
              that's what makes the difference. The style of our house, which we
              have continued to refine over the past 15 years, is our design
              philosophy of Sensual Purity. It is our aesthetic soul and the
              core of our brand DNA. With it, we have created independent
              product personalities and given all Mercedes brands an
              unmistakable appearance. Our design language uniquely combines
              beauty with the extraordinary. To create tension, for example, we
              link opposites - this deliberate bipolarity of emotion and
              intelligence characterises our designs. Beauty forms the emotional
              core for us - it has its very own magic. Everything we do must be
              aesthetic. Beauty fascinates people and exerts a great attraction
              - all around us: in nature, in art, in fashion - and even in cars.
              But that alone is not enough for us: We strive to give beauty the
              additional glamour of the extraordinary. That is what we aim for
              as Mercedes designers: revolutionary products that touch people
              emotionally and that people absolutely want to have." - Gorden
              Wagener
